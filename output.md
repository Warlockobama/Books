Step 4: Organize Entries in Obsidian Create a New Note: Open Obsidian and create a new note for your audiobook listings. Paste Formatted Entries: Copy the cleaned and formatted text from your text editor into the new Obsidian note. Use Headings and Tags: Utilize headings (e.g., #, ##) to separate entries and consider adding tags for easier navigation.

Tags: Add tags like #audiobook, #finished, or genres to categorize your entries.
